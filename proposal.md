# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

Someone opened the door

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

A security device that alerts you someone opened the door

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

So the project will be a home seceruity thing so i will use a hardware called a micro bit which i will use as the sensor. It will be executed by when someone opens a door the sensor will go off and it will alert my phone that someone opened the door. The features it will have is kinda like a smart remote access feature since it will send me a message saying the door was opened rather than just the normal beeping noise of a traditional old school security system. 

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?



## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

Not collaborating

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

I will accomplish understanding the hardware that is neccesary for this project.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

I think i can accomplish this project before the deadline.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

I hope to accomplish just understanding the skills used for this project and i hope it will be fun with no major setbacks.

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

My next steps first would be to buy the hardware needed to accomplish this project. The new skills i will need to acquire are integrating hardware considering that it's not just IDLE and it's only on my computer but it's real world stuff. The research i will need to do is the backround of coding in like home security devices and how it works.
